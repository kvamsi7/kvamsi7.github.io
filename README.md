## üíª Selected Projects

---

### **1. Chain of Thought (CoT) in LLMs ‚Äì Paper Implementation**

This project replicates the work on **Chain of Thought (CoT)** reasoning in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The implementation of CoT allows the LLMs to perform better on complex reasoning tasks without requiring multi-shot learning.

- **Technologies**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Deep Learning
- **Features**:
  - Implemented **zero-shot** CoT reasoning for LLMs
  - Demonstrated improvements in model scaling and performance across various datasets
  - Replicated results from the "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners" paper by leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning


---

### **2. Sentiment Analysis using BERT**

A sentiment analysis model built with **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for classifying text (e.g., product reviews) as either positive or negative. This project demonstrates fine-tuning transformer-based models for NLP tasks.

- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Features**:
  - Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model on a custom sentiment dataset
  - Used **Hugging Face Transformers** for efficient model training and deployment
  - Deployed the model via a **Flask API** for easy integration with web apps

### **3. Machine Translation using Autoencoder and Decoder**

A sequence-to-sequence model for machine translation using an **autoencoder architecture** with an encoder-decoder approach for translating text from one language to another.

- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLP, Neural Networks
- **Features**:
  - Built an encoder-decoder architecture for sequence translation
  - Trained on parallel corpora for multilingual text translation
  - Implemented attention mechanism for improved performance in longer sequences

### **4. Accessing Credit Risk using Machine Learning**

A machine learning model that predicts whether a customer‚Äôs profile is **risky** or **safe** based on financial data. The model evaluates risk factors such as credit history, loan amount, and payment history.

- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, Machine Learning
- **Features**:
  - Utilized classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for risk classification
  - Trained and validated on a real-world financial dataset
  - Deployed the model as a **web app** (Link to the deployed version: [Credit Risk Web App](http://ec2-3-140-255-188.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5002/?))
